# Log Of Changes in the Code

* Added crowdSourcing.sol and Ownable.sol (provided by Open Zeppelin)
* Split the main crowdSourcing contract into multiple contract .sol files
* Removed the onlyOwner modifier definitions from Worker and TaskPoster contracts since this functionality is now provided by the Ownable contract.
